Creating a simple navigation with the implementation of gsap for JavaScript animation.

## Notice

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

### Implementing

```

```

### Timeline

- A Timeline is a powerful sequencing tool that acts as a container for tweens and other timelines, making it simple to control them as a whole and precisely manage their timing. Without Timelines, building complex sequences would be far more cumbersome because you'd need to use a delay for every animation
